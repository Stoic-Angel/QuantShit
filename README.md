## Algorithmic Trading
* Intro - This Python script analyzes stock data to optimize portfolio selection. It uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data and implements several analysis techniques. 
* Strat_Backtesting - Built MACD and a vanilla MACD strat (generated decent returns) and then a Williams %R alongwith MACD to counter exaggerations and make the strategy more versatile.
